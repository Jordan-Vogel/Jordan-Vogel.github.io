# About Me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jordan, and I will be graduating this spring with a degree in Bioengineering from the University of Washington.

As a student deeply immersed in the fascinating world of bioengineering, I've embraced the challenges and opportunities that come with this field. My academic journey has been a blend of rigorous coursework and hands-on experiences, both of which have been instrumental in shaping my problem-solving mindset and technical prowess.

Here's a bit more about what I've been up to:

- **Problem-Solving Mindset**: Tackling complex problems is at the heart of bioengineering. Through my studies, I've learned to approach challenges systematically, combining creativity with analytical skills to find innovative solutions.

- **Technical Skillset**: My coursework has equipped me with a diverse set of technical skills. From computational biology to biomaterials engineering, I've had the opportunity to explore various dimensions of bioengineering and apply these concepts in practical settings.

- **Undergraduate Research**: Engaging in undergraduate research has been a cornerstone of my academic experience. It has not only allowed me to contribute to advancing our understanding of biological systems but also helped me develop critical thinking and experimental design skills.

This GitHub page serves as a digital logbook, documenting some of the projects I've worked on and ideas I've explored throughout my journey in bioengineering. It's a reflection of my academic endeavors, research experiences, and my continuous pursuit of knowledge in this dynamic field.

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub page!
