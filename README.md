# About Me

Hello! My name is Jordan, and I will be graduating this spring with a degree in Bioengineering from the University of Washington.

As a bioengineering student, I'm fully engaged in this challenging and rewarding field. My education has been a mix of in-depth coursework and practical experience, both critical in developing my problem-solving skills and technical knowledge. This path has sharpened my ability to tackle complex issues and has prepared me with the skills necessary for innovation in bioengineering.

This GitHub page serves as a digital logbook, documenting some of the projects I've worked on in bioengineering. It's a reflection of my academic endeavors, research experiences, and my continuous pursuit of knowledge in this dynamic field.

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub page! Check out some of my work below:
