# About Me

Hello! My name is Jordan, and I am a recent Bioengineering graduate from the University of Washington.

As an engineer, I'm fully engaged in this challenging and rewarding field. My education has been a mix of in-depth coursework and practical experience, both critical in developing my problem-solving skills and technical knowledge. This path has sharpened my ability to tackle complex issues and has prepared me with the skills necessary for innovation in technology.

This GitHub page serves as a digital logbook, documenting some of the projects I've worked on. It's a reflection of my academic endeavors, research experiences, and my continuous pursuit of knowledge.
