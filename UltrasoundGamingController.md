# Ultrasound Accessible Gaming Controller
Adaptive gaming controllers are designed to enable individuals with limited mobility to play video games. The majority of these devices involve pushing buttons, making this controller inaccessible for people who do not have to use their hands. For my final project in my Bio-signal Processing course, I designed a handsfree device that allowed a user to control four inputs using head movements via an ultrasonic range-finding device.

# Hardware and Circuit Design
The device is built around an Arduino Uno microcontroller. We used two ultrasonic distance sensors to track head movements. To show the inputs, we added four LEDs and also included an OLED module for a clearer display of the inputs. A diagram of the circuit is included below.
